# Roam plugins by Adam Krivka

This is the **home of my Roam Reserach plugins**. 

## List of plugins

* [roam/sr](roamsr) - spaced repetition in Roam
* [pyroam](pyroam) - Python notebooks in Roam
* [LittleScripts](littlescripts) - a collection of small hacks

## What I'm working on

I just finished the MVP of pyroam and plan to shift my focus towards roam/sr more again, but I'm stuck on a few conceptual and technical issues so I'm not sure how fast the progress is going to be and if I might not take another detour to some of my other ideas (the biggest one of which right now is probably roam/convert - a better markdown exporter).

## Donations 

I'm not money-constrained, but if you feel like you want to buy me a beer for what I'm doing, you can do so here (big thanks for everyone who has already donated!).
